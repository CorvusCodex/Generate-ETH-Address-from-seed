# Generate-ETH-Address-from-seed
Generate ETH Address from seed using python

Python script that generates an Ethereum address from a seed phrase. The script uses the eth_keys library to derive a private key from the seed phrase and then uses that private key to generate a public key and an Ethereum address. The generate_address function takes in a seed phrase as an argument and returns the generated Ethereum address.
